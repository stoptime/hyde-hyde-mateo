# Hyde-hyde-mateo

**`Hyde-hyde-mateo`** is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme inspired and derived from @htr3n's [Hyde-hyde](https://github.com/htr3n/hyde-hyde) theme. I began tweaking it to the point where I thought my own version would be easier to work with, and share.

Working example: https://www.mattmayes.com

Current changes are related to colors, layout, and performance.

## Noteworthy Updates

- 1/7/2020 - inlined primary/print theme css (not toc related). If your compressed css is under 10kb, this is good - improved my mobile page score from 76 to 94. [Lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes) is now baked into the theme, check the link for how to use.
- 2/2/2021 - started work on dark mode (using media query)

### In the works:

- Search

### ToDo:

- Update exampleSite
- Removed unused css
